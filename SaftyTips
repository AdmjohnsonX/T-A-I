      },
      {

        "tip": "If being honest with him always leads to drama, your nervous system will start hiding the truth to survive."
      },
      {
        "tip": "If he makes fun of your standards, he’s telling you he doesn’t intend to meet them."
      },
      {

      },
      {
        "tip": "If he overshares intimate details of previous partners, assume he could do the same with your secrets."
      },
      {
        "tip": "If you feel the need to track his mood before you speak, your body is telling you it’s in survival mode, not safety."
      },
      {
        "tip": "If you are constantly on edge waiting for his reaction, it’s a sign the relationship is not gentle on your nervous system."
      },

      },
      {
        "tip": "You don’t have to attend every argument you’re invited to; hanging up or walking away can be an act of self-protection."

      {
        "tip": "If he ignores your messages but is active online, believe his behavior instead of his excuses."
      },

      },

      },
      {
        "tip": "If every good moment is followed by a crash, your nervous system never gets to feel truly safe with him."
      },
      {
        "tip": "If you feel you’re always one mistake away from losing his affection, that love is conditional and unstable."
      },
      {
        "tip": "If he reacts with jealousy to your growth, success, or glow-up, that energy will eventually hold you back."
      },
      {
        "tip": "If he pressures you to send money, lend your card, or sign documents, always protect your financial safety first."
      },
      {
        "tip": "If you catch him lying about small things and he shrugs it off, understand that honesty is not his habit."
      },
      {
        "tip": "If you keep giving chances and nothing changes, each chance is costing you more of your peace."
      },
      {
        "tip": "If you feel physically tense after being around him, give your body time alone and listen to what it is telling you."
      },
      {
        "tip": "If he mocks your boundaries as ‘rules,’ he is telling you he prefers your comfort to have no structure."
      },
      {
        "tip": "If your dreams get quieter the longer you date him, ask whether your future is safe in his presence."
      },
      {
        "tip": "If you feel isolated from your usual support system, notice who benefits from that isolation."
      },
      {
        "tip": "If he punishes you with long silences instead of talking things through, he is using distance to control you."
      },
      {
        "tip": "If you feel pressure to forgive quickly without real change, remember that forgiveness without safety is self-abandonment."
      },
      {
        "tip": "If he tries to make you jealous on purpose, he is playing games with your emotions, not protecting your heart."
      },
      {
        "tip": "If your mind keeps replaying the same hurtful moments, that’s your brain showing you what still isn’t safe."
      },
      {
        "tip": "If you are scared to set one more boundary because he might leave, the relationship is already running on fear."
      },
      {
        "tip": "If you feel like you’re constantly fixing or mothering him, ask if there’s any space left for your own needs."

        "tip": "If he calls you clingy when you ask for basics like clarity and respect, he may be avoiding accountability."
      },
      {
        "tip": "If he refuses to clarify where you stand but still wants full access to you, protect your heart and step back."
      },
      {
        "tip": "If he pressures you to move faster physically, emotionally, or financially, pause and return to a pace that feels safe."
      },

      },
      {
        "tip": "If you’re constantly explaining your basic needs and he still doesn’t adjust, he is choosing his comfort over your safety."
      },
      {
        "tip": "If your body feels lighter at the thought of ending things than staying, that feeling is a powerful compass."
      },
      {
        "tip": "If he threatens to expose private messages or photos, that is abuse and you deserve help and protection."
      },
      {
        "tip": "If he reacts with anger when you set digital boundaries—like muting or limiting access—that’s control, not hurt feelings."
      },
      {
        "tip": "If you feel like you always have to ‘earn’ his good days, that emotional roller coaster is not love."
      },
      {
        "tip": "If the relationship constantly feels like survival mode instead of partnership, your safety—emotional and physical—is at risk."
      },

      {
        "tip": "If he shows up unannounced to ‘surprise’ you after you said you’re busy, see it as boundary-testing, not romance."

      },
      {

      },
      {
        "tip": "If he talks proudly about past cheating or ‘player’ behavior, assume he hasn’t fully outgrown it."
      },
      {
        "tip": "Notice how he reacts when you win, succeed, or get attention. Real safety feels like support, not competition."
      },
      {
        "tip": "If you ever think, ‘I hope he doesn’t get mad about this,’ pause and question why you’re afraid."
      },
      {

      },
      {
        "tip": "If he ignores your boundaries around social media—DMs, tags, or posts—expect him to ignore bigger boundaries, too."

      },
      {
        "tip": "When he raises his voice, watch how quickly he calms himself down. Self-control matters for long-term safety."
      },

        "tip": "If he laughs when you express fear or discomfort, understand that he is unsafe emotionally, at minimum."
      },
      {

      },
      {
        "tip": "Avoid saving his excuses; save his patterns. Consistency tells you more than one perfect apology."
      },
      {
