    "tips": [
      { "tip": "Date with standards, not desperation. If his effort is low, your interest should be too." },
      { "tip": "If you feel anxious around him more than appreciated, that’s a signal, not a soulmate." },
      { "tip": "Stop overexplaining your worth. The right man will recognize it without a sales pitch." },
      { "tip": "Mixed signals are a clear signal: he’s not sure about you. Don’t build a future on confusion." },
      { "tip": "A consistent man doesn’t leave you guessing. Pay more attention to patterns than promises." },
      { "tip": "You are not a rehab center. His trauma is not your responsibility to fix or heal." },
      { "tip": "If you have to chase him, you’re already out of alignment. Lean back and let effort speak." },
      { "tip": "Don’t minimize your standards just to avoid being alone. Lonely with someone still feels lonely." },
      { "tip": "If you’re always the one adjusting, compromising, and apologizing, that’s not love. That’s imbalance." },
      { "tip": "Your emotional safety matters more than his potential. Choose the man he is, not the man you hope he becomes." },
{ "tip": "If he wanted to, he would. Stop writing love stories in your head when his actions read like a short text thread." }
{ "tip": "You are not hard to love. You’re just no longer available for shallow, inconsistent attention." }
{ "tip": "Chemistry is exciting, but character is what keeps you safe. Don’t let sparks blind you to red flags." }

{ "tip": "A man who truly likes you won’t make you guess. Clarity is a green flag, confusion is not." }
{ "tip": "You don’t need to prove you’re ‘chill.’ Respect your feelings instead of hiding them to keep him." }
{ "tip": "Your standards are not ‘too much.’ They’re a filter that removes the wrong men from your life." }
{ "tip": "Stop romanticizing effort that is bare minimum. Flowers are nice, emotional safety is better." }
{ "tip": "Silence is also an answer. When he pulls away, don’t chase—observe and adjust your energy." }
{ "tip": "You can be soft and still have strong boundaries. Kindness does not require self-abandonment." }
{ "tip": "The right man won’t be scared of your standards. He’ll be grateful you have them." }
{ "tip": "Do not beg for love, attention, or commitment. What you beg for today, you’ll resent tomorrow." }
{ "tip": "If you feel like a secret instead of a priority, consider that the relationship might be hiding you." }
{ "tip": "Your attachment to his potential is not the same as his willingness to grow." }
{ "tip": "A man who is serious about you plans ahead, not just ‘pulls up’ when he’s bored." }
{ "tip": "If you have to constantly decode his behavior, the message is already clear: it’s not healthy." }
{ "tip": "A healthy man makes your life more peaceful, not more dramatic." }
{ "tip": "You don’t need to shrink to fit his comfort zone. The right man will expand with you." }
{ "tip": "The urge to overgive is often a trauma response, not a love language. Give from overflow, not emptiness." }
{ "tip": "Pay attention to how he treats you when he’s frustrated. That’s when his real character shows." }
{ "tip": "Do not confuse emotional intensity with emotional intimacy. One is chaotic, the other is safe." }
{ "tip": "You don’t ‘fix’ your insecurity by getting his validation. You fix it by trusting yourself more." }
{ "tip": "If every date leaves you more confused than excited, pause and re-evaluate." }
{ "tip": "You are allowed to leave a date that feels off. You don’t owe anyone your discomfort or time." }
{ "tip": "Consistency is romantic. Good morning texts mean nothing if he disappears emotionally." }

{ "tip": "If you’re constantly explaining why you deserve respect, you’re in the wrong room." }
{ "tip": "You’re not asking for too much, you’re just asking the wrong man." }
{ "tip": "Stop scripting his responses in your head. Let his real behavior tell you who he is." }
{ "tip": "If you feel like you’re auditioning for the role of ‘girlfriend,’ walk off that stage." }
{ "tip": "A man who is interested will remove obstacles, not hide behind them." }
{ "tip": "You don’t have to be perfect to be loved. You just have to be honest and aligned." }
{ "tip": "Healthy love feels like collaboration, not competition for his attention." }
{ "tip": "Watch how he talks about his exes. It reveals how he might talk about you one day." }
{ "tip": "Don’t let loneliness negotiate your standards down to crumbs." }

{ "tip": "If he mocks, minimizes, or makes jokes about your feelings, that’s emotional immaturity, not humor." }
{ "tip": "Your boundaries will scare off the wrong men and attract the right ones. Let them do their job." }
{ "tip": "Love should not feel like constant anxiety management. Calm is a love language too." }
{ "tip": "If you can’t be honest with him, you’re not safe with him." }
{ "tip": "The more you respect your time, the faster time-wasters disappear." }
{ "tip": "You don’t need closure from him to move on. Your decision to be done can be the closure." }

{ "tip": "Low effort early becomes disrespect later. Believe the preview." }
{ "tip": "Pay attention to: Does he listen, remember, and apply? Or does he just apologize and repeat?" }
{ "tip": "You’re allowed to say, ‘This doesn’t work for me,’ even if he’s a ‘good guy’ on paper." }
{ "tip": "A ‘good guy’ who doesn’t meet your emotional needs is still the wrong guy." }
{ "tip": "If his words and actions don’t match, always trust the actions." }
{ "tip": "You are not dramatic for wanting emotional consistency and effort." }
{ "tip": "Don’t mistake sexual attention for genuine interest in your life." }

{ "tip": "Your desire to be chosen should never outweigh your commitment to choose yourself." }
{ "tip": "The right man won’t make you compete with other women for basic respect." }

{ "tip": "If you feel safer overthinking than asking a direct question, that’s already your answer." }
{ "tip": "You don’t have to earn rest, care, or love. You are worthy of them just by existing." }
{ "tip": "The right man will not ask you to prove that you’re ‘different from other women.’" }
{ "tip": "When a man shows you he’s emotionally unavailable, believe him the first time." }

{ "tip": "Stop ignoring how you feel just because you like how he looks." }
{ "tip": "You’re allowed to change your mind about him once you have more information." }
{ "tip": "Healthy flirting doesn’t leave you feeling ashamed, objectified, or confused." }
{ "tip": "If he disappears when you set a boundary, the boundary worked. Let him go." }
{ "tip": "You don’t need to wait months to recognize misalignment. Early patterns are powerful data." }
{ "tip": "A relationship should add to your life, not become a project that consumes it." }
{ "tip": "If you prevent every conflict to ‘keep the peace,’ you’re sacrificing your own peace." }
{ "tip": "Pay attention to where you over-function. Are you doing his emotional labor too?" }
{ "tip": "You can be compassionate without tolerating disrespect or chaos." }
{ "tip": "A man who genuinely respects you won’t pressure you sexually or emotionally." }
{ "tip": "The right man won’t label your standards as ‘trauma’ just to avoid accountability." }
{ "tip": "You don’t have to tie your self-worth to whether he chooses you. You choose you first." }
{ "tip": "Stop editing your needs to seem easier to love. Real love can handle your truth." }

{ "tip": "Don’t lower the volume of your intuition just to keep hearing from him." }
{ "tip": "A man who wants to be in your life will make it obvious. Confusion is often a rejection in slow motion." }

{ "tip": "Healthy attraction feels grounding, not addictive and chaotic." }
{ "tip": "If you can’t imagine bringing your true self on the date, cancel the date." }
{ "tip": "The version of you that begs, chases, or overproves isn’t the real you. She’s just scared." }

{ "tip": "If he makes you question your memory or sanity, that’s not confusion—that’s likely manipulation." }
{ "tip": "You’re not required to be ‘low maintenance.’ You’re allowed to have needs and preferences." }
{ "tip": "If he respects you, he respects your time. Lateness, flakiness, and last-minute plans are data." }
{ "tip": "Do not confuse trauma bonds with love. Intensity plus inconsistency is a red flag combo." }
{ "tip": "If you feel like you have to ‘earn’ his basic decency, step away. Decency is the baseline." }
{ "tip": "Notice how your body feels around him. Your nervous system often speaks before your mind does." }
{ "tip": "When you stop chasing, you give the right men space to find you and the wrong ones space to leave." }
{ "tip": "You don’t need to be ‘chill’ about things that actually hurt you." }
{ "tip": "Your standards should reflect your healed self, not your wounded self." }
{ "tip": "If he jokes about cheating or losing you, pay attention. Jokes often reveal real attitudes." }
{ "tip": "You are allowed to say no without explaining, defending, or apologizing." }
{ "tip": "A man serious about you will make your life simpler, not constantly put you in dilemmas." }
{ "tip": "If you feel like his part-time option, stop giving him full-time access." }

{ "tip": "You don’t need to trauma-dump on the first date, but you also don’t need to fake perfection." }
{ "tip": "If he can’t handle a calm conversation about feelings, he’s not ready for a mature relationship." }
{ "tip": "The more you heal, the less attracted you’ll be to inconsistency and emotional games." }
{ "tip": "You deserve someone who is emotionally available, not just physically present." }
{ "tip": "Look for alignment in values, not just alignment in playlists and hobbies." }
{ "tip": "If he shames you for your standards, that’s proof you need them." }
{ "tip": "A man who cares about you will be curious about your world, not just your body." }
{ "tip": "If every good moment is followed by chaos, that’s not passion—that’s instability." }
{ "tip": "You can hold space for his struggles without sacrificing your own mental health." }
{ "tip": "You deserve more than late-night texts and vague promises. Desire is shown in daylight too." }
{ "tip": "If you’re always waiting—waiting for clarity, effort, or commitment—you’re not in a relationship, you’re in a loop." }
{ "tip": "Love isn’t supposed to feel like you’re constantly auditioning to not be abandoned." }
{ "tip": "If you feel like you’re parenting him more than partnering him, the dynamic is off." }
{ "tip": "Emotional maturity is attractive. Look for men who can apologize, reflect, and change." }
{ "tip": "You’re allowed to be selective. High standards just mean you understand your value." }
{ "tip": "If he treats you as an option, see yourself as the decision-maker—and choose differently." }

{ "tip": "You don’t need to accept confusion just because you’re afraid of starting over." }
{ "tip": "A man who wants you will not treat communication like a chore." }
{ "tip": "If his presence brings chaos to every area of your life, his absence might bring clarity." }
{ "tip": "You are allowed to desire romance, effort, and intention. Don’t downplay your heart." }
{ "tip": "If he only acts right when he’s afraid of losing you, he’s negotiating, not growing." }
{ "tip": "Love doesn’t require you to ignore patterns. You can forgive and still choose to walk away." }
{ "tip": "Your future self will thank you for leaving at the first consistent sign of disrespect." }
{ "tip": "Don’t sacrifice your peace for potential. Long-term chaos is too high a price." }
{ "tip": "When you stop trying to be ‘chosen,’ you start naturally filtering for men who choose you effortlessly." }

{ "tip": "You’re not hard to love. You’re just done accepting love that hurts your peace." }
{ "tip": "Chemistry is fun, but character keeps you safe. Don’t ignore who he really is." }
{ "tip": "If you feel more anxious than adored, your body is telling you this isn’t it." }
{ "tip": "A man who truly likes you won’t keep you guessing. Certainty is a green flag." }

{ "tip": "Healthy love will not feel like constant emotional turbulence." }
{ "tip": "Never shrink your dreams to fit his comfort zone." }
{ "tip": "Overgiving doesn’t make you more lovable. It just makes you more exhausted." }
{ "tip": "Watch how he acts when he’s upset. That reveals more than how he acts when he’s sweet." }
{ "tip": "Intensity is not intimacy. Real intimacy feels safe, not chaotic." }
{ "tip": "Validation from him won’t fix insecurity. Self-trust will." }
{ "tip": "If every date leaves you confused, stop dating him and start reflecting on why you stay." }
{ "tip": "You’re allowed to leave a date early if you feel off. Safety beats politeness." }
{ "tip": "Consistency is sexier than charm. Charm fades when effort disappears." }

{ "tip": "A ‘nice guy’ who doesn’t meet your needs is still the wrong guy." }
{ "tip": "Feeling drained after talking to him is a sign, not a phase." }
{ "tip": "Busy is real, but effort is visible even in busy seasons." }

{ "tip": "If you’re scared to ask where you stand, deep down you already know." }
