      {
        "tip": "Your life should not pause for a man. Keep pouring into your goals, friendships, and hobbies—dating should add to your life, not replace it."
      },
      {
        "tip": "You are allowed to be selective. Wanting a high-quality partner does not make you picky; it makes you intentional."
      },
      {
        "tip": "A man who is truly interested will make things clear, not confusing. Mixed signals are a loud answer—believe them."
      },
      {
        "tip": "Your standards are not negotiable just because someone is attractive or charming. Chemistry is a bonus, not a reason to ignore values."
      },
      {
        "tip": "You do not need to shrink your personality to be more ‘dateable.’ The right man will enjoy your real energy, not a watered-down version."
      },
      {
        "tip": "Your body, time, and attention are valuable. You choose who earns access to them, and ‘lonely’ is never a good enough reason."
      },
      {
        "tip": "If you feel anxious all the time with him, that is not ‘butterflies’—that is your nervous system warning you something is off."
      },
      {
        "tip": "You will never have to convince the right man to treat you right. Genuine effort comes naturally to someone who truly cares."
      },
      {
        "tip": "A man being ‘afraid of commitment’ is not your project. You are a woman to build a life with, not therapy for his fear of intimacy."
      },
      {
        "tip": "You are not behind in life just because you are single. Everyone’s timeline is different, and yours is not a race."
      },
      {
        "tip": "A relationship is not a reward for fixing yourself. You are worthy of love even while you are still healing and growing."
      },
      {
        "tip": "You do not need to over-explain why you are not interested. ‘No, thank you’ is a complete sentence."
      },
      {
        "tip": "If he only talks to you late at night or when he is bored, he is not confused—he is using you for convenience."
      },
      {
        "tip": "You are not ‘too emotional.’ Your feelings are valid information; anyone who dismisses them is showing their emotional immaturity."
      },
      {
        "tip": "A healthy man will never make you feel like you are competing with other women for his attention. Clarity is part of respect."
      },
      {
        "tip": "You do not need to give endless chances. Patterns matter more than apologies, and change is proven by consistency."
      },
      {
        "tip": "You are allowed to walk away from almost right. Almost right will keep you stuck and unavailable for what is truly right."
      },
      {
        "tip": "Your worth does not increase because someone chooses you, and it does not decrease because someone walks away."
      },
      {
        "tip": "If he is confused about you, take that as your answer. A man who genuinely wants you will not risk losing you by being unclear."
      },
      {
        "tip": "You never have to prove that you are ‘different from other girls.’ You do not need to compete with a stereotype to be valued."
      },
      {
        "tip": "Your intuition is a real form of intelligence. If something feels off, you do not need evidence to start creating distance."
      },
      {
        "tip": "You are allowed to be soft and strong at the same time. Vulnerability is not weakness—it is emotional courage."
      },
      {
        "tip": "The right relationship will not require you to abandon your dreams. The right partner will support and elevate them."
      },
      {
        "tip": "You do not need to tolerate disrespect just to avoid being alone. Peaceful solitude beats chaotic company every time."
      },
      {
        "tip": "If you feel drained after most interactions with him, that is not love—it is emotional exhaustion wrapped in attachment."
      },
      {
        "tip": "You are allowed to set dating rules that protect your heart, time, and energy. Boundaries do not make you difficult; they make you safe."
      },
      {
        "tip": "If he disappears when life gets hard for you, he is not your safe space. Love shows up especially when things are tough."
      },
      {
        "tip": "You are not obligated to ‘fix’ a man because you care about him. Compassion does not require self-abandonment."
      },
      {
        "tip": "You deserve effort outside of the talking stage. Attention during the chase means nothing without consistency after."
      },
      {
        "tip": "You are allowed to say you want commitment. Wanting a real relationship does not make you clingy; it makes you honest."
      },
      {
        "tip": "You do not have to match chaos with chaos. Protect your peace by responding calmly or walking away entirely."
      },
      {
        "tip": "Your boundaries will scare away the wrong men and attract the right ones. Anyone threatened by them is not for you."
      },
      {
        "tip": "You are allowed to enjoy being single and still desire love. Both can exist without cancelling each other out."
      },
      {
        "tip": "Do not chase closure from someone who disrespected you. Their behavior already gave you all the closure you need."
      },
      {
        "tip": "You are not asking for too much; you are just asking the wrong person. The right man will happily give what others resisted."
      },
      {
        "tip": "If you feel like you must constantly prove your value, you are already undervalued there. Real appreciation does not need convincing."
      },
      {
        "tip": "You do not need to rush intimacy to keep someone interested. A man who loses interest because you set a pace is not serious about you."
      },
      {
        "tip": "Your past mistakes in love do not define you. They are lessons that built the wiser, stronger version of you today."
      },
      {
        "tip": "If he keeps you a secret but claims he cares, he is protecting his options, not your feelings."
      },
      {
        "tip": "You are not ‘lucky’ to be chosen; you bring value too. A relationship is an exchange of greatness, not a favor done to you."
      },
      {
        "tip": "You deserve someone who is excited to claim you, not someone who is half-in, half-out, and always ‘thinking about it.’"
      },
      {
        "tip": "You are allowed to leave any situation that confuses your heart. Love should bring clarity, not constant doubt."
      },
      {
        "tip": "Do not ignore the way your body reacts around him. Tight chest, upset stomach, restless sleep—your nervous system speaks loud."
      },
      {
        "tip": "You are worth consistent communication. You should not have to beg to be texted back, called, or checked on."
      },
      {
        "tip": "If you always feel like a backup plan, you probably are. Stop accepting a spot in someone’s life that is beneath your value."
      },
      {
        "tip": "You deserve dates that match your effort, not last-minute plans whenever he is bored. Preparation shows priority."
      },
      {
        "tip": "You are allowed to walk away from ‘situationships’ that never evolve. Time invested does not mean you owe more time."
      },
      {
        "tip": "If he makes you feel crazy for asking basic questions, that is gaslighting, not love. Your clarity matters."
      },
      {
        "tip": "You are enough even on your quiet, unglamorous days. The right man will cherish the everyday version of you, not just the highlight reel."
      },
      {
        "tip": "You do not have to lower your voice, your laughter, or your opinions to keep a man. Your authenticity is your filter."
      },
      {
        "tip": "If you feel lonelier with him than you did alone, that relationship is not feeding your soul."
      },
      {
        "tip": "You are allowed to want emotional maturity. Your standards for communication, honesty, and accountability are valid."
      },
      {
        "tip": "A man being ‘busy’ 24/7 is rarely the real problem. Effort is about priority, not available time."
      },
      {
        "tip": "You deserve someone who is proud to grow with you, not someone who feels intimidated by your progress."
      },
      {
        "tip": "You are not responsible for how others mistreated him before you. His trust issues are not yours to repair alone."
      },
      {
        "tip": "If he only shows up when you pull away, he is addicted to the chase, not committed to you."
      },
      {
        "tip": "You do not have to earn love by over-giving. Healthy love is a balance, not you pouring from an empty cup."
      },
      {
        "tip": "You are allowed to ask, ‘What are we?’ If he benefits from your presence, he can handle a conversation about direction."
      },
      {
        "tip": "If his words and actions do not match, believe the actions. Consistency is the real love language."
      },
      {
        "tip": "You deserve to be chosen in public, not just desired in private. Real love is not hidden."
      },
      {
        "tip": "You are allowed to leave the table when respect is no longer being served, no matter how long you have been sitting there."
      },
      {
        "tip": "You are not hard to love; you just require honesty, effort, and emotional safety—things the wrong men may not want to provide."
      },
      {
        "tip": "You deserve a love that feels like home, not a war you constantly have to win."
      },
      {
        "tip": "If he talks badly about every ex, listen carefully. One common denominator in all his ‘crazy ex’ stories is him."
      },
      {
        "tip": "You are allowed to rest from dating without feeling guilty. Taking breaks to recharge is self-respect, not giving up."
      },
      {
        "tip": "You deserve reciprocity. You should not always be the planner, comforter, and emotional support without receiving the same energy back."
      },
      {
        "tip": "You are not obligated to entertain someone just because they like you. Attraction is mutual or it is a no."
      },
      {
        "tip": "If he keeps saying he is not ready for a relationship, believe him the first time and stop trying to be the exception."
      },
      {
        "tip": "You deserve a partner who brings you peace, not someone who apologizes for the same behavior over and over."
      },
      {
        "tip": "You are allowed to want romance and effort, not just ‘hanging out.’ Casual energy will never create committed results."
      },
      {
        "tip": "You deserve to feel emotionally safe expressing your needs. If he punishes you for honesty, he is not a safe partner."
      },
      {
        "tip": "Your self-respect must be stronger than your desire to be chosen. Never betray yourself just to keep a man."
      },
      {
        "tip": "You are allowed to end conversations that feel disrespectful or draining. Protecting your peace matters more than being polite."
      },
      {
        "tip": "If you always feel like you are walking on eggshells, pay attention. Healthy love does not make you fear simple conversations."
      },
      {
        "tip": "You deserve someone who listens to understand, not listens just to defend themselves."
      },
      {
        "tip": "You are allowed to start over at any age, with a new mindset and new standards. It is never too late to choose better."
      },
      {
        "tip": "You deserve more than breadcrumbs of attention. If he can post memes all day, he can answer your text."
      },
      {
        "tip": "You are allowed to keep your dating standards even when people call you ‘demanding.’ You live with the results, not them."
      },
      {
        "tip": "If a man truly values you, he will not put you in a position where you have to question your worth."
      },
      {
        "tip": "You deserve a partner who is emotionally available, not someone who uses you as a distraction from their unhealed wounds."
      },
      {
        "tip": "You are allowed to say, ‘This is not enough for me,’ even if nothing ‘terrible’ happened. Lack of effort is enough reason."
      },
      {
        "tip": "You deserve to be with someone who chooses you on your hard days, not just when you are fun and easy."
      },
      {
        "tip": "You are allowed to expect honesty from the beginning. Lies in the little things become lies in the big things."
      },
      {
        "tip": "If you feel like you are always explaining the bare minimum to him, he is not as confused as he pretends—he just benefits from doing less."
      },
      {
        "tip": "You deserve pleasure and joy in love, not just survival and emotional emergencies."
      },
      {
        "tip": "You are allowed to want a man who puts in real effort without you having to threaten to leave."
      },
      {
        "tip": "If you constantly feel second to his phone, friends, or ex, believe that you are not his priority right now."
      },
      {
        "tip": "You deserve to be with someone who speaks kindly to you, especially in conflict. Love does not excuse verbal cruelty."
      },
      {
        "tip": "You are allowed to raise your standards when you outgrow your old ones. Growth is not being ‘bougie’; it is evolution."
      },
      {
        "tip": "You deserve a partner who is curious about your mind, not just your body."
      },
      {
        "tip": "You are allowed to request consistency. Random affection and random attention are not enough for emotional security."
      },
      {
        "tip": "If you have to dim your light to keep him, you are already losing too much. Real love allows you to shine."
      },
      {
        "tip": "You deserve someone who remembers the little things you say, not someone who treats you like you are forgettable."
      },
      {
        "tip": "You are allowed to step away from people who flirt with you but never commit. Your time is too precious for endless almosts."
      },
      {
        "tip": "You deserve loyalty even when you are not in the room. Love is proven in how they represent you when no one is watching."
      },
      {
        "tip": "You are allowed to say you want someone emotionally intelligent. Emotional chaos is not passion; it is dysfunction."
      },
      {
        "tip": "If he belittles your dreams or mocks your goals, he is not your teammate. The right man will cheer for your growth."
      },
      {
        "tip": "You deserve someone who makes space for your emotions without calling you ‘dramatic’ every time you express them."
      },
      {
        "tip": "You are allowed to feel proud of the version of you that finally walks away from what hurt you."
      },
      {
        "tip": "You deserve dates that feel safe, respected, and fun—not like interviews where you must prove you are worth basic decency."
      },
      {
        "tip": "You are allowed to prefer slow, intentional relationships over rushed, intense connections that burn out quickly."
      },
      {
        "tip": "If you feel more anxious waiting for his replies than excited to talk to him, your nervous system is not at peace there."
      },
      {
        "tip": "You deserve a partner who does not make you guess where you stand. Clarity is a love language."
      },
      {
        "tip": "You are allowed to see rejection as protection. What did not work out was not meant to hold you back from better."
      },
      {
        "tip": "You deserve a love story where you feel chosen, cherished, and respected, not one where you feel like you must earn love every day."
      },
      {
        "tip": "You are allowed to admit when you ignored red flags and still choose to love yourself enough to leave now."
      },
      {
        "tip": "You deserve someone who thinks long-term with you, not someone who only plans the next link-up."
      },
      {
        "tip": "You are allowed to remind yourself that the bare minimum—kindness, respect, replies—is not enough to keep you anymore."
      },
      {
        "tip": "You deserve a partner who speaks about you with pride, not one who hides you to keep his options open."
      },
      {
        "tip": "You are allowed to be happy alone while you wait for someone who matches your energy, instead of settling out of impatience."
      },
      {
        "tip": "You deserve someone whose actions calm your nervous system, not someone whose behavior constantly triggers your fears."
      },
      {
        "tip": "You are allowed to stop explaining your value to people who are committed to misunderstanding it."
      },
      {
        "tip": "You deserve more than being loved for your potential. The right person will appreciate who you are right now."
      },
      {
        "tip": "You are allowed to say, ‘This version of love does not feel safe,’ and choose something healthier for yourself."
      },
      {
        "tip": "You deserve a partner who shows up on your bad days with patience, not someone who disappears when things are not easy."
      },
      {
        "tip": "You are allowed to treat your heart like a luxury item. Not everyone should have access to it."
      },
      {
        "tip": "You deserve to feel wanted, not tolerated. Being ‘good enough for now’ is not the same as being truly cherished."
      },
      {
        "tip": "You are allowed to outgrow people who only knew the insecure version of you. Your healed self has different standards."
      },
      {
        "tip": "You deserve someone who values your emotional safety as much as their own comfort."
      },
      {
        "tip": "You are allowed to accept when someone is not emotionally available and stop auditioning for a role they are not ready to fill."
      },
      {
        "tip": "You deserve to be in spaces where your softness is protected, not used against you."
      },
      {
        "tip": "You are allowed to choose men who pursue you with clarity instead of chasing the ones who confuse you."
      },
      {
        "tip": "You deserve to feel secure enough to be yourself without fear that being real will make him leave."
      },
      {

      },
      {
        "tip": "You are allowed to reserve your nurturing side for those who genuinely pour back into you."
      },

        "tip": "You deserve to feel emotionally safe enough to say what you really think without fear of retaliation."
      },

        "tip": "You deserve a love that does not confuse your nervous system every other week."
      },
